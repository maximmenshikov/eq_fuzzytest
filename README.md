# FuzzyTest

This project is a demonstration of random program generation as applied to
static analyzers. It is not intended for usage outside the main project.

The random source code is generated, and then it undergoes several shuffling
transformations.

## Bulding
Use ```cmake``` for building.

## Usage
The typical use case would be to generate files in a designated directory, e.g.:

```
fuzzytest output_path
```
